Context : I want to build the front-end for my full stack pong website. I want a clean design implementation with separation of concerns. Not a random throw everything in 2 functions/files. Basically, the stack use is TypeScript + TailwindCss (no framework). The site must be a SPA. The landing page is pretty much a login page (+ OAuth options of course). Once logged in, there is the user page with its information, and panels to see stats, play games, see friends etc.

Focus on the ProfileCard : When I click on the edit profile button, I want to :

- Display a splash screen in the center of the screen
- A form with fields : name, email, upload avatar and enable 2FA

Focus on Profile View in general :

- I want to populate the user name, profile etc. with the API calls (update avatar, name, email, enable 2FA)
